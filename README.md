**Back-End API tests for the CoinMarket API**

**Background:**

I have tried implementing the assignment using cucumber-restassured style. 
Added one feature file "CoinMarketCap.feature" in which all 3 test cases are implemented


How to Run : Please run the CucumberTests.java file to invoke the cucumber which will then execute all the scenarios.
